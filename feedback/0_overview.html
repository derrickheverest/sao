<h1>Feedback Overview</h1>
<p>There are three different roles that can help offer feedback.  These roles usually should not be done together.  Instead, you should focus on one of these roles and fulfill it to the best of your ability.  The three roles are as follows: </p>
<ol>
	<li>The Ah-Counter</li>
	<li>The Grammarian</li>
	<li>The Evaluator</li>
</ol>

<p>The Ah counter focuses on individual words.  It is picky about filler words and likes to point out repetitive words and on occasion, misspelled words</p>

<p>The Grammarian does not look at inidivial words.  Instead, he is concerned with finding Gems and Germs.  A Gem can be Something that sounds quotable.  It can be a part or several parts that were written beautifully.  A Germ can be a part that was offensive.  A Germ can be a gramatically INCORRECT sentence.</p>

<p>The Evaluator focuses on content.  He focuses on structure.  Each story should have a clear structure to it.  The evaluator looks for 3 pieces of content that he enjoyed and 2 parts that could use some improvement.</p>
