<h1>The Evaluator Role</h1>
<p>The Evaluator looks at the big picture.  It looks at the content.  Is the content well structured?  Is the message clear?  The Evaluator should pick three things that he likes about the piece and two things that could use some improvement.  When you describe the good stuff, you should state why it matters to you and show specificly where this good stuff happened.  When you describe the bad stuff, state why it matters and how the author of the piece could have improved it</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Every story should be well structured.  Whether it is long or a shot story, there should be a structure to it. </p>
