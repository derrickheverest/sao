<h1>The Ah-Counter Role</h1>
<p>The purpose of the Ah-Counter is to count the number of filler words.  Imagine an entree that you ordered from a restaurant.  You take one bite of the food and it tastes really plain.  You take another bite and suddenly it is super salty! yuck! Then you take another bite and it is revoltingly sweet.  The problem?  <b>The the lack of mixing and possible an over dose</b></p>
<p>The Ah-counter should count these as filler words:</p>
<ul>
	<li>and</li>
	<li>so</li>
	<li>like</li>
	<li>ya know</li>
	<li>basically</li>
	<li>uh</li>
	<li>um</li>
</ul>
<p>However, keep in mind that SOME filler words are neccesary.  You should only count it as a filler word when the use of the word does not help add meaning or if the use is repetitive; think about that over-seasoned entree.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Ah-Counter should count words that are being used way to much.  The english language is full up many words that mean the same thing.  Use this to your advantage.  Go grab a thesaurus!</p>
